### Color Depth
The amount of data used to represent a single pixel

| size  | color option |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 bit | 1 color: on or off |
| 2 bit | 1 color with intensity (think of greyscale) |
| 3 bit | Red, Green, Blue with on or off |
| 4 bit | RGB with intensity |
| 6 bit | RGB each color has its own intensity |
| 3 byte | RGB each color with 256 possible intensities |

### Other Color Spaces
__RGBA__: red, green, blue + alpha (transparency)
__HSB__: hue, saturation, bightness
- hue: angle measurement
- saturation: radius of base of cone
- brightness: height of cone

### Image File Formats
__Raster vs. Vector__
Vector formats represent images as a series of drawing instructions
- infinitely scalable
- good for stuff like fonts and shapes, not so good for actual pictures
- SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics

Raster formats represent images as a grid of pixels
